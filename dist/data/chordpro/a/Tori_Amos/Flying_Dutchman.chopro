FLYING DUTCHMAN by Tori Amos
From the U.K. single "China"
Transcribed by Justin Solonynka

Corrections and clarifications are completely welcomed

Please Note: Attempting to transcribe piano music into something readable on
e-mail poses difficulties, but with a song like "Flying Dutchman" those
difficulties are multiplied greatly.  To my knowledge, the sheet music has not
been published, and what appears here is what I have figured out by ear.  I
have attempted to make this as complete as I could while making it legible.
In order to save my sanity, I have not transcribed the way (I think) Tori
plays all of the F-C-G vamps, since she varies it almost every time.  By
experimenting with the chords I give for the "main vamp", you should be able
to come reasonably close to the way the song sounds on the recording.
