[Fmaj9]Never was a [Am7]cornflake girl    [C6]
[D7sus4]Thought that was a go[Fmaj9]od solution
Hangin wi[Am7]th the raisi[C6]n girls
She's [D7sus4]gone to the other side[Fmaj9]
Givi[Am7]n us [C6]a yo heave ho
[D7sus4]Things are g[Fmaj9]etting kind of gross
And I[Am7] go at sleepy t[C6]ime


[D]This is not really, t[Am7]his a this a this is not really happe-ning
[C6]You bet [D7sus4]your life it is
You be[Fmaj9]t your life it is
Oh, [C]you   [Dm]bet   [C/E]your   [G]life


It's a [D]peel o[G]ut the w[D]atch - word just[G] peel out the watchword

[Fmaj9]She know[Am7]s what's [C6]going on
[D7sus4]Seems we got [Fmaj9]a cheaper feel now
All the sweet te[Am7]ars a[C6]re gone
[D7sus4]Gone to the other side
[Fmaj9]With my encyclo-pa[Am7]edia   [C6]
They [D7sus4]musta paid her a nice price

[D]This is not re[Am7]ally, this a this a this is not really happening
[C6]You bet [D7sus4]your life it is
You be[Fmaj9]t your life it is
Oh, [C]you   [Dm]bet   [C/E]your   [G]life


It's a [D]peel o[G]ut the w[D]atch - [G]word just peel out the watchword
