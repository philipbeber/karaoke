     I don't believe I  went too far                   
I said I was willing willing willing

     Past the  mission behind the prison tower
past the mission I once knew a hot girl
past the mission they're closing every hour
past the mission I smell the roses

G                                 C   (sus4)
She said they all think they know him well
she knew him better better        better
everyone wanted something         from him
I did too but I shut my           mouth
he just gave me a                 smile

    Dm          C                 F         C
not sure it was his still they're using his name and
Dm     C        Dm  C       Dm       C                  Dm
she gave him shelter     and somewhere I know she knows

somewhere I know she knows
      C                         Dm
somethings only she knows...
