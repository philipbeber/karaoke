{inline}[Bb5]               [Ab5]       [Bb5]

Lies, lies, lies, everywhere
Said the father to the son
Your peppermint breath's gonna choke him to death, daddy
Watch your little black sheep run
He got the knives, knives, knives in his back every
Time he opens up
He says "You gotta be strong if you wanna be a man," mister
I don't know how you can have
Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
Land, land of liberty, we're run by a
Constipated man
When you live in the past you refuse to see, when your
Daughter come home, nine months pregnant, with your
Five billion points of light, you're gonna
Shine 'em on the face of your friends
They got the earth in a sling, they got the world on her knees
They even got your zipper between their teeth
Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams

BRIDGE:
[Db]You say, you [Ab]say, you [Eb]say that you [Ab]have 'em
[Db]I say that [Ab]you're a [Bb]liar
[Bb5]Swee --[Ab5]eet [Bb5]Dreams, [Bb5]Swee --[Ab5]eet [Bb5]Dreams

(short solo over Bb5 and Ab5 vamp)

Then [Db]go on, [Ab]go on, [Eb]go on, go on [Ab]and [Db]dream
Your [Eb]house is on [Bb5]fi --re [Ab5]     [Bb5]   come along now

(  vamp)
W[Bb5]ell [Ab5]well, Summer wind been
Catching up with me
Elephant mind, missy you don't have, you're for-
getting to fly, darling when you speak, I gotta
Hazy, lazy susan
Taking turns all over my dreams
I got lizards and snakes, running through my body
Funny how they all have my face
Sweet Dreams
Sweet Dreams

(Repeat Bridge)

(End with Bb5 Ab5 vamp)
