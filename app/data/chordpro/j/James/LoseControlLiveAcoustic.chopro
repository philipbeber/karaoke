{t: Lose Control Live Acoustic}
{st: James}
They opened with this in Manchester, it sounded amazing so I tried to get the chords.


{inline}[Am]-[Em]-[Dm]

Where is the l[Am]ove
Where is the l[Em]ove
Where is the [Dm]love that every[Em]one's been dreaming of

Basically three down stokes on each chord- sounded really haunting with just Tim's 
have it on my phone so will try and make a more complete tab, though it sounded pretty much 
this throughout.
