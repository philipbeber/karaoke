The Last Mall

please note:
There are intregal bass notes played throughout this selection, that are not included in the
 body of this chart.  
When I first included these bass notes in this chart, it all looked like a very confusing mess!
To simplify matters I will explain how these bass notes are played:
On the C7 chord throughout the verses a F-E-C ( IV-III-I )
bass figure is played.
On F7 chord following C7chord Bb-A-F is played and on G7 and on any F
chord following the G7, Bb-C-root is played.

In the instrumental section, the song modulates to the key of D.
The same IV-III-I applies on the D chord and the first two bars of
The G chord following. The next two bars in G change to Bb-C-G bass notes and 
the following A7 chords C-D-A. Again I recommend first playing along with the recording and
being in a place where pausing and rewinding can be done quickly!
