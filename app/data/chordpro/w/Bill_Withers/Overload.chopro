Overload

Chords:     
Notes:  [F#] The c[G]hords repeat themselves through out the song...

Strange fear I ain't felt for years
The boy's coming and I'm close to tears
I can't let go of you now

Imagination's playing round for free
In my world I take him out for tea
Oh my God, can't say no

Skipping school, go walk for air
I just had to get out of bed
I'm on overload in my head

Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation

Life is a dream, time does come true
And in my sleep I think of you
Feather bed by myself

Basically probability
Says that fate's come side with me
It's been so long on my shelf

Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation

The tension is incredible, boy I'm in charge
You know how I feel for you, 
Will you stop, or will you just keep going
Please don't say no, no, no, no

Train comes I don't know its destination
(Yeah yeah yeah)
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
(Situation)
Train comes I don't know its destination
(I know, I know)
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
(Situation)

Train comes I don't know its destination
(Our secret's safe in bed)
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
(Situation)
Train comes I don't know its destination
(I know, I know)
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
(Got me feeling bad)
