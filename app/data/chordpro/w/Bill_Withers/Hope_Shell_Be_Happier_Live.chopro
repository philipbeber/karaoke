Maybe the lateness of the hour
Makes me seem bluer than I am
But in my heart there is a shower,
I hope she'll be happier with him.
Maybe the darkness of the hour
Makes me seem lonelier than I am,
But over the darkness I have no power,
Hope she'll be happier with him.

I can't believe that she don't want to see me,
We lived and loved with each other so long.
I never thought that she really would leave me,
But she's gone.

Maybe the lateness of the hour
Makes me seem bluer than I am,
But in my heart there is a shower,
Hope she'll be happier with him.
