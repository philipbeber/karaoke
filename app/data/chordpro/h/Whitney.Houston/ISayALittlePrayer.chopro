       Verso 1:
        The[Em7] moment I wake[Am7] up
        Before I put [D7]on my [G7M]makeup
        I [F#m7]say a little prayer for [B7-9]you
        [Em7]While combing my ha[Am7]ir, now
        And wondering what [D7]dress to[G7M] wear now
        I [F#m7]say a little prayer for [B7-9]you

        Fore[C]ver, for[D/C]ever, you'l[Bm7]l stay in m[G/B]y heart
       
        And I will love you
        Fore[C]ver, and[D/C] ever,[Bm7] never apa[G/B]rt

        While riding I thin[D7]k of u[G7M]s, dear

        At [Em7]work I just take [Am7]time
        And all through my c[D7]offee break[G7M] time
        I [F#m7]say a little prayer for[B7-9] you


        [Em7]My darling, be[Am7]lieve me
        For me there is[Am7/D] no one   but[G7M] you
